# IoT-Security

To get this to work on your network, you need to make sure you are on your subnet. Open the terminal and enter "ipconfig" and you need to edit the subnet in the code to your default gateway. It is currently set on Temple's network on some random access point. For example, my default gateway at my apartment is 10.0.0.1 so you would enter 10.0.0 in the parameter. You edit the parameters in the switch statement in the main where I have it commented.
